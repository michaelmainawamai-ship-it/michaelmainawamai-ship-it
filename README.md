Paste the content above into your GitHub profile README (`README.md`) to make it your profile README. To commit and push the change locally, run the following in PowerShell from the repository root:

```powershell
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add poetic profile README"
git push
```

If you'd like, I can also:

- Create a separate `README.profile.md` and keep the project README intact.
- Help replace the placeholder links with your real social links.
- Run the git commands for you here (I will not push without your permission).

Tell me which option you prefer and if you'd like me to run the commit for you now.
